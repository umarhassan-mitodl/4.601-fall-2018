Course Description
------------------

_People are sexually aroused by pictures and sculptures; they break pictures and sculptures; they mutilate them, kiss them, or cry before them, and go on journeys to them; they are calmed by them, stirred by them, and incited to revolt. They give thanks by means of them, expect to be elevated by them, and are moved to the highest levels of empathy and fear. They have always responded in these ways; they still do._  
—David Freedberg, _The Power of Images_, 1989

People also pay extraordinary amounts of money for works of art, build museums for them, steal them, and frequently attempt to censor them. This course investigates the power of art in historical perspective. It focuses on Euro-American traditions of art, the social and cultural practices that defined them, and the analytic tools available to help us interpret the diverse meanings and functions of art works in the past and at present. Engaging selected works—from paintings to prints to other kinds of crafted objects—and artistic developments from the fourteenth to the twentieth-first century, we will examine changing conceptions of the artist, the work of art, and the discipline of art history. Our brief is to explore the multiple roles images and objects have played over time, how they functioned in various social, economic and cultural contexts, and whose interests they served or sought to disrupt.

Throughout, we will attend to questions of gender and representation, patronage and politics, the meanings of materials, as well as the impact of new technologies and of historical interactions between Europe, America, and the wider world: How did devotional practices, science, colonialism, and global trade shape Euro-American conceptions of art and artists? How do institutions such as the art market, the art museum and the temporary exhibition define what is and isn’t art? And what does the contemporary reception of art tell us about its—and our—place in our globalizing world?
