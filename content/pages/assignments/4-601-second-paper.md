Authenticity
------------

### Paper Topic

Rembrandt van Rijn (1606–1669) is arguably one of the most famous European painters of the seventeenth century, but his oeuvre (body of work) has been notoriously difficult to establish. In 1969, a committee of art historians, called the Rembrandt Research Project (RRP), was convened to examine the more than 600 paintings then attributed to Rembrandt and to determine which were painted by the artist and which were not. The project generated controversy over its methods and its determination that a number of celebrated paintings in major museums, including _Man with the Golden Helmet_ in the State Museums of Berlin, _Young Woman at an Open Half-Door_ in the Art Institute of Chicago, and the _Polish Rider_ in the Frick Collection in New York, are not, in fact, by Rembrandt. Recently, several paintings deattributed to Rembrandt have been reattributed to him.

These deattributions and reattributions were reported in several national and international newspapers and in magazines like Time. Authenticity is important it seems, and not only to art historians. But _why_ is it important? Basing your analysis on the following articles, write a 5–7 page paper assessing the issue of authenticity. What were some of the methods used by the RRP to attribute or deattribute paintings to Rembrandt, and why were/are they controversial? Why does it (or doesn’t it) matter whether the paintings under discussion are by Rembrandt? What is our investment as modern viewers in authenticity?

This is not a research paper. You should base your analysis on the following short articles:

*   Ernst van de Wetering, “Connoisseurship and Rembrandt’s Paintings: New Directions in the Rembrandt Research Project, part II.” _Burlington Magazine_ 150 (February 2008): 83–90.
*   Sylvia Hochfield, “Rembrandt: Myth, Legend, Truth.” _ARTnews_ 105 (Summer 2006): 156–67.
*   Sylvia Hochfield, “What is a Real Rembrandt?” _ARTnews_ 103 (February 2004): 82–93.
*   J.S. Marcus, “An Expert Cites Dozens of Paintings as Rembrandt’s.” _Wall Street Journal_, October 8, 2014.
*   Nelson Goodman, “Authenticity.” _Oxford Art Online_, 1996.

The following reading is not part of the assignment. It is the article to which van de Wetering responds in his text. You are, of course, welcome to discuss it in your paper if it helps you support your claims:

*   Christopher Brown, “The Rembrandt Year.” _Burlington Magazine_ 149 (February 2007): 104–108.

### Grading Policy

*   The paper will count for 15% of your course grade.
*   The paper is due by the end of the day on Tuesday of week 10. **Late papers may be penalized one third of a letter grade per day.**
*   _Quality of Your Arguments_. Your grade does not depend on whether you are right or wrong but on the quality of your observations and arguments. Make sure to support your arguments with evidence.
*   _Errors in Grammar and Spelling._ One third of a grade may be deducted for every five typographical or grammatical errors that appear in your paper. In cases where the same error is repeated over and over, each instance may be treated as a separate error. Thus, if your grade would have been a B+ but you have five grammatical or spelling mistakes (even if they are all instances of the same error) you may receive a paper grade of B. If your grade would have been a B+, but you have ten grammatical or spelling mistakes, you may receive a grade of B- and so on. **Please proofread your paper.**
*   _Intellectual Honesty._ Please be sure to properly footnote any direct quotes from the readings that you use and any ideas that are not your own that you paraphrase in your paper. If you are found to have plagiarized any part of your paper, you will receive an automatic grade of F for the course and will be reported to the appropriate Institution committees for disciplinary action.
